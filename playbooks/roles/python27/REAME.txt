# Install Python 2.7 on CentOS

## Introduction

This Ansible role will install Python 2.7 if not existed.

This role is tested on CentOS 6. CentOS 7 is provided with Python 2.7 by default.

In CentOS 6, python 2.6 is the default python installation. It is used by some of the most important services (e.g. YUM), thus cannot be removed.
This role will install Python 2.7 on CentOS 6 along with Python 2.6 and enable it through the python2.7 command.

## Requirement

  - ansible >= 2.2 (using remote_src with unarchive module)
